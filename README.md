# Ecommerce Product Price Tracking

### Project Overview

The E-commerce Product Price Tracker is a Python-based automation project utilizing Selenium WebDriver to monitor and record the prices of products on e-commerce websites over time. This tool is designed for users who want to keep track of price fluctuations, identify trends, and make informed purchasing decisions based on historical price data.

### Features

  - Automated Web Scraping: The project uses Selenium WebDriver to navigate through e-commerce websites and scrape product prices at regular intervals.
  - Multi-page Navigation: The tool is capable of navigating through multiple pages of search results or product listings to collect comprehensive price data.
  - Data Storage: The collected price data is stored in a structured format (e.g., CSV, Excel, or a database) for easy retrieval and analysis.
  - Historical Price Analysis: By recording prices over time, the project enables users to perform historical price analysis and identify trends or patterns.
  - Error Handling and Logging: The tool includes robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and to facilitate troubleshooting.
  - Customizable Tracking: Users can customize the list of products to track and set the frequency of data collection according to their needs.

### Technologies Used

  - Python: The core programming language used for developing the project.
  - Selenium WebDriver: A powerful tool for web automation, used to interact with and extract data from web pages.
  - Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library, used for organizing and storing the scraped data.
  - Excel/CSV: File formats used for saving the collected data, making it accessible for future analysis.
  - Database (Optional): For advanced users, the project can be configured to store data in a relational database like MySQL or SQLite.

### Workflow

  - Initialization: The user initializes the script and sets the target e-commerce website(s) and product(s) to track.
  - Web Navigation: Selenium WebDriver navigates to the specified website and searches for the target product(s).
  - Data Extraction: The script locates the product prices on the page, extracts the relevant data, and parses it using BeautifulSoup.
  - Data Storage: The extracted data is organized into a Pandas DataFrame and saved to a CSV/Excel file or a database.
  - Loop and Schedule: The script loops through the steps at user-defined intervals to continuously update the price data.

### Use Cases

  - Consumers: Individuals can use this tool to track the prices of products they are interested in purchasing, helping them to buy at the best possible price.
  - Analysts: Market analysts can use the historical data to identify trends and patterns in product pricing.
  - Retailers: Retail businesses can monitor competitor pricing strategies and adjust their own pricing accordingly.

### Future Enhancements

  - Email Notifications: Implementing an email alert system to notify users when a product's price drops below a specified threshold.
  - Graphical Analysis: Integrating data visualization tools to generate graphs and charts for easier analysis of price trends.
  - Mobile App Integration: Developing a mobile app to provide users with real-time price tracking and alerts on the go.

### Conclusion

The E-commerce Product Price Tracker is a comprehensive solution for monitoring and analyzing product prices on e-commerce websites. By leveraging the power of Python and Selenium, this project offers users an automated, customizable, and efficient way to stay informed about price changes and make smarter purchasing decisions.
